# Nowcasting-US-GDP-growth-rate-during-the-financial-crisis
The scope of this assignment is to estimate different forecasting model of the growth rate of the US GDP, namely our variable $y$, through the high-frequency Index of Coincident Indicators ($ci$) which includes four indicators: nonfarm payroll employment, the unemployment rate, average hours worked in manufacturing and wages and salaries. This index is critical in forecasting US GDP growth because it tracks economic metrics that move in real-time with the overall economy  and represents components of economic activity that are directly related to GDP.

The first model we see is the Bridge Model. Here, first of all, monthly indicators are predicted over the remainder of the quarter, on the basis of a univariate time series model, and then aggregated to obtain their quarterly correspondent values. Second, the aggregated values are used as regressors in the bridge equation to obtain forecasts of GDP growth. Next, we proceed to compute the MIDAS Model, which is closely related to the distributed lag (DL) model, but in this case the dependent variable $y_t ^L$, sampled at a lower-frequency, is regressed on a distributed lag of $x_t ^H $, which is sampled at a higher-frequency. Finally, we estimated the U-MIDAS model, which offers greater flexibility by estimating each lag individually, while MIDAS restricts them through lag structures to maintain simplicity and prevent overparameterization. Our findings revealed that the MIDAS model initially performed best with a minimal information set in October. However, as the information set expanded, the U-MIDAS model emerged as more accurate due to its ability to optimally select variable lags via the Gets approach, effectively minimizing forecast error without imposing rigid coefficient restrictions. Conversely, the Bridge and traditional MIDAS models, with their fixed and restrictive weighting methods, proved less flexible and ultimately less effective.
